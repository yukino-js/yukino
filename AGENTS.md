- ZERO backward compatibility. Breaking changes are expected, acceptable, and preferred over legacy support.
- NEVER maintain conditional logic for older versions, dead code, deprecated APIs, or shim layers. Remove them aggressively.
- If fixing a bug or updating/implementing a valuable feature causes old tests to fail, follow ZERO backward compatibility: implement the correct behavior, update or remove obsolete tests, and update all outdated comments. NEVER preserve defective behavior or add compatibility logic merely to satisfy old tests.
- Only add comments where the code is not self-explanatory. Usage of these comments should be rare.
