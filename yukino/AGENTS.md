This project is fully aligned with ~/github/yukino-code/apps/yukino.

- MUST be aligned 1:1; functional trade-offs and implementation differences caused by TypeScript/Go language differences are acceptable.
- Align file by file, 1:1 — no spot-checking and no guessing.
- Project scripts may use JS/TS only.
- ZERO backward compatibility. Breaking changes are expected, acceptable, and preferred over legacy support.
- NEVER maintain conditional logic for older versions, dead code, deprecated APIs, or shim layers. Remove them aggressively.
- If fixing a bug or updating/implementing a valuable feature causes old tests to fail, follow ZERO backward compatibility: implement the correct behavior, update or remove obsolete tests, and update all outdated comments. NEVER preserve defective behavior or add compatibility logic merely to satisfy old tests.
- Only add comments where the code is not self-explanatory. Usage of these comments should be rare.
